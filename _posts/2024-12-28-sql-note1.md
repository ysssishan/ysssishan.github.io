Before writing any SQL (or indeed, any other language) query to retrieve data, the first step is to figure out the desired data.   
That's a broad topic that I won't talk about in this post üò£.   
However it's crucial to keep this mindset from the very beginning: know exactly what we want.  
  
  
  
  
# **The Order Matter** 

This section will be focusing on the order of execution for SQL commands.   

A common basic SQL query typically follows this structures:
```SQL
SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE ...
GROUP BY ...
HAVING ...
ORDER BY ...;
```
  
The computer process this query in the following order:
1. **FROM**: Access the specific **table**;
2. **WHERE**: Apply filters to retrieve relevant **rows**;
3. **GROUP BY**: Group the **rows** retrieved in step 2;
4. **HAVING**: Apply filters to the **groups of rows** formed in step 3;
5. ***SELECT***: Decide which **columns** will be retrieved;
6. **ORDER BY**: order the **retrieved data**.

Notably, the SELECT command is executed **after** WHERE, GROUP BY, and HAVING.   
  
Therefore, when advanced queries are involved in the SELECT command, such as [Window Functions](#wf), and *Analytics Functions*, they are only applied *after the WHERE, GROUP BY, and HAVING* commands have been processed.   
That is to say, **we cannot filter table based on columns generated by Window Functions or Analytics Functions in the SELECT command.**

Generally, **to achieve this, we have to create a table using *Common Table Expression (CTE)* to storage the new columns created.** We can then filter data based on them.  
This advanced SQL query will follow this structures:
```SQL
WITH new_table AS (
    SELECT 
        *,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY a ORDER BY b) as rn
    FROM
        table
)
SELECT *
FROM new_table
WHERE rn = 1
GROUP BY ...
HAVING ...
ORDER BY ...;
```


# Window Functions {#wf}

Window functions:
1. **can not** be involved in: *WHERE*, *GROUP BY*, and *HAVING*.
2. **can** be involved n:*SELECT*, *ORDER BY*.

Generally  we use 





# **Deal With Complex String: Regular Expression Functions** {#Regular-Expression-Functions}

Love it‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è.  
They are super powerful in dealing with complex string. 

1. **Matches character within a string: REGEXP**

    This is a commonly used basic regular expression function.    
    Use it when you want to check if any data in a specific column match the *pattern* you set.

    Metacharacters demonstration:
    - string **begin** with 'a': put **^** at the beginning
    ```SQL
    SELECT *
    FROM table
    WHERE column REGEXP '^a';
    ```
    - string **end** with 'a': put **$** at the end
    ```SQL
    SELECT *
    FROM table
    WHERE column REGEXP 'a$';
    ```
    - string **contain** 'a' or 'b': put **|** in between
    ```SQL
    SELECT *
    FROM table
    WHERE olumn REGEXP 'a|b';
    ```
    - string **contain** any of 'a''c''g': put character inside **[]**
    ```SQL
    SELECT *
    FROM table
    WHERE column REGEXP '[acg]';
    ```
    - string **contain** any from a to g: put character inside **[-]**
    ```SQL
    SELECT *
    FROM table
    WHERE column REGEXP '[a-g]';
    ```
    - string **contain** a specific amount of characters: 
        - contain a specific amount
            - put specific amount of **.** in between **^** and **$**
                ```SQL
                SELECT *
                FROM table
                WHERE column REGEXP '^......$'; -- in this case 6 characters
                ```
            - or a more simple and clear version: put the amount inside the **{}** and put it behind the **.**
                ```SQL
                SELECT *
                FROM table
                WHERE column REGEXP '^.{6}$'; -- in this case 6 characters
                ```
        - contain any amount (could be zero or more)
            ```SQL
            SELECT *
            FROM table
            WHERE column REGEXP '^.*$'; -- * represent any amount
            ```
    - string/substring **begin** with "a" following by "b": put **(?=b)** behind a
    ```SQL
    SELECT *
    FROM table
    WHERE column REGEXP 'a(?=b)';
    ```
    - use **()** to seperate metacharacter if you involve a lot of conditions
    ```SQL
    SELECT *
    FROM table
    WHERE column REGEXP '^(a|b).*(c|d)$'; -- any substring that start with a or b, and end with c or d
    ```


2. **Split a column with string** in the form of "a,b,c,d,e" or anything like that:
```SQL
SELECT
    *,
    regexp_split_to_table(column_to_split, ',') AS split_column
    -- column_to_split: replace with the column you want to split
    -- ',': replace with the delimiter used in the column
FROM
    table
```
