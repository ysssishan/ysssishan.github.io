🎄Merry Christmas!🎄圣诞快乐！🎄Joyeux Noël!🎄Fröhliche Weihnachten!🎄
<p>
In this special first post, I reflected my moving around after reading Calvino's Invisible Cities again. 
</p>

<p>
I returned to Frankfurt(am Main) last week from Paris. It's been 10 months since I left Germany for an exchange semester at Sciences Po. Everything feels a bit strange, yet strangely familiar. <br>
What makes me awkward is that I cannot stop saying "Merci" and "Pardon" to germans. Actually, this happens before, when I first arrived in Paris. During the first month, I often said "Danke" and "Entschuldigung" to parisians.😂<br>
